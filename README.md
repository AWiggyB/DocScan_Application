### RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

Run DocScan from its installation-folder or run it through the short-
cut created on the Desktop.


### UPLOAD A PDF DOCUMENT TO DOCSCAN:

At the homescreen, click "SELECT DOCUMENT" to load a .pdf file from 
the machine. 


### GENERATE QR CODE:

Once a pdf document has been selected, click "GENERATE QR CODE" to 
generate a unique Quick Response (QR) code to the document, which is 
later used to determine the original document's authenticity. 


### UPLOAD TO DATABASE:

With a QR code generated and placed onto the document, it can be up-
loaded to the DocScan database by clicking "SAVE & UPLOAD" which be-
comes clickable after a QR code has been generated.


### [OPTIONAL] PRINT THE DOCUMENT:

Within the pdf preview section, it is possible to print the document 
before or after the generation of QR code should it be preferred.

NOTE: A document containing a QR code being printed without being 
uploaded first, holds no value other than a regular document because 
the QR code will not function.
